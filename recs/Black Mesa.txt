Controversial opinion: This game received a lot of praise for updating the
graphics and level design of Half Life 1. I think the graphics still look like
a rough source engine mod, the load times are unacceptably long for a modern
game with these graphics and level size, and the level design is extremely
dated and intuitive. I tried to finish this game but ended up ditching it
because it just simply wasn't fun. Maybe pick it up if you want to see what the
hype was all about or if you want to see why Half Life was such a keystone game
in the industry but in my opinion, Half Life provided a many ideas that other
games have since improved upon.
