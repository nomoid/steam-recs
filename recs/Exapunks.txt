A game for nerds who think coding in pseudo-assembly would make for a fun game.
The presentation makes it much more accessible than similar games from
Zachtronics like Shenzhen I/O (although those games are great too). Even though
it might not look like an actual game, trust me this title is actually quite a
bit of fun.
