Best sonic game ever made. A love letter to games like Sonic 3 & Knuckles and
Sonic 2, this game preserves the tight physics and expansive level design that
made those games classics while also innovating on existing game mechanics and
ideas. A must play if you have any fond memories of old-school platforming
games or if you want to see why Sonic became the massive IP it is now.
