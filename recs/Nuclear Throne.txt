IMO, still the greatest game in the genre of top-down, twitch shooter
rogue-lites. Gameplays is very arcadey and reaction heavy, gunplay feels and
sounds amazing and there's a wide variety of guns and enemies to encounter as
you complete loops. Hasn't been updated in ages but this game still features
the tightest, most satisfying combat I've seen.
