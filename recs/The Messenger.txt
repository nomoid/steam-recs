A love-letter to retro games like Metroid and Ninja Gaiden. Tight gameplay,
memorable music, and some pretty funny, or at least endearing writing. The free
dlc has slightly worse level design and a pretty bad difficulty curve but hey,
it's literally free extra content. Make sure to listen to the shopkeeper!
