Top-down shooter rogue-lite with the reloading system from Gears of War. Less
arcadey and more tactical feeling than games like Nuclear Throne or Binding of
Isaac. Sound design of the guns is top notch and the combination of the
overheating system, active reloading, and potential for gun jamming leads to
many incredibly hectic moments where good awareness and calm are rewarded. Main
issues are the technical performance of the game and the poorly designed
difficulty curve.
