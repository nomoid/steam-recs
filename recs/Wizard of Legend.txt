A short and sweet roguelike with simple systems and clean execution. Wizard of
Legend hits the elemental magic meets martial arts fantasy presented by
universes like Avatar. Difficult enough to be challenging, but easy enough to
not be frustrating, Wizard of Legend can be an approachable introduction to the
roguelike genre.
