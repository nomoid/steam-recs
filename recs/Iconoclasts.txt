Game made by 1 fella, very charming visuals and pretty fun gameplay. Music is
really solid, surprisingly compelling story with fun characters but man does
this game just drag on too long. Writing also gets quite a bit unfocused,
partially as a consequence of the scope of the game being just too much for one
person.
