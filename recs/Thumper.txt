You are space beetle flying on a rail smacking sick beats and fighting
psychedelic face monster bosses. Super percussive soundtrack that fits the
aesthetic of the game wonderfully. Probably the best game I've played at
getting me into a super focused flow state. Highly recommend playing with
controller. A very high recommendation if you have a vr setup.
