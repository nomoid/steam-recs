Very weird adventure game with cool visuals and even cooler music. Gameplay can
be a bit repetitive and the controls were originally designed for a touch
interface. Overall game though is greater than the sum of its parts but will
definitely be a bore if you are looking for anything with deep gameplay
mechanics.
