Reasonably difficult boss rush game. Gameplay consists 50% of learning boss
patterns and reactive timings and 50% of bullet hell segments (except for the
very last boss, the worst fight in the game). Parry timing might feel a bit off
but definitely something you can get used to. Game is designed around having 2
playthroughs, one on normal and then another on hard.
