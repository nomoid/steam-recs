The game that popularized the roguelike deckbuilder genre, Slay the Spire is a
classic that still stands as one of the best. Runs are unique enough that
hundreds of hours can slip away replaying the ascent, and the range of
difficulty can provide a challenge for even veteran players. Also excellent
modding support.
