Space exploration game with unrivaled freedom and an excellent mystery to
solve. Go in blind if you can.

A really cool space exploration game that is focused around and learning about
how the world works. Also a game about being alone while in a way, never
actually being alone. Highly recommend playing through as blind as possible
(although if you end up frustrated at Dark Bramble I wouldn't blame you for
look up a guide). Also here's a cool video essay about the game
