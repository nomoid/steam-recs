Play as the monster of a horror game as you try to escape a facility and figure
out what you are. Pretty fun gameplay and controls and does a pretty solid job
of immersing you in the role of a horror monster. Primary complain is that the
game's length is short but personally I think the game is a pretty perfect
length at maintaining pacing of new mechanics without outstaying it's welcome.
