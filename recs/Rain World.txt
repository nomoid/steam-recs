Probably the most hardcore survival game out there. Play as a little slug-cat
trying to live in an inhospitable world. You can die to lizards, tentacle
monsters, starvation, and even the rain. The world feels alive, with
consistent, realistic behavior of the various animals that seem to live and act
externally from you. Although there is an easy mode, the demoralizing
atmosphere is quite central to the game's design and I would recommend that if
you do pick up the game, you play on normal. Absolutely not a game for people
who dislike brutal difficulty.
