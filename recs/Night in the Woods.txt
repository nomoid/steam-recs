Really interesting adventure game where you play as a college dropout going
back home to a place reminiscent of a dying midwestern town in America. Some of
the writing is on the nose but in a way that makes sense for the age of many
of the characters and a lot of it actually hit pretty close to home for me.
The direction they took the ending was definitely the weakest part of the game
(although there is a cool interpretation of the events you could take) but
every other part of the game was a delight to play. Probably one of the best
games at portraying ideas like being stuck in poverty and mental illness.
